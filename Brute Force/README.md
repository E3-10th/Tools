(Brute.js ... Get_array.py ... pass.txt ... user.txt) are together to form the brute force program. 

Get_array.py transformes the pass.txt or user.txt list into an array to plug into the Brute.js code.

you can copy the code and paste it into the consloe of the login page you want to brute force and press enter for it to run.

dont forget to place the ID names of the username, password and login button into their correct variables.
